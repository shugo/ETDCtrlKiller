ETDCtrlKiller
=============

ETDCtrl.exe is software to control touchpads, and sometimes remains at 25%
CPU usage.  If ETDCtrl.exe is disabled, the CPU consumption can be decreased,
but the touchpad settings will be reverted to default values when resumed from

one minute later so that it doesn't spend CPU.
